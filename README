=================
Unisonotify
=================

A small wrapper script for unison that uses libnotify
to indicate when unison started and how it completed.

The script can be called via cron or anacron to automate data synchronisation.

Installation
=============

The only requirement for the main script is 
unison (should be on the system PATH) and the
python-notify package.

On ubuntu or debian run::

  apt-get install python-notify unison


Create unison profiles for the folders you want to
synchronize and optionally add scripts to ``/etc/cron.hourly`` to automatically
run the synchronisation with anacron::

  #/bin/sh
  # /etc/cron.hourly/65-unison-sample
  #run script with user privileges
  su username
  # call the wrapper script and pass the profile "sample"
  /path/to/unisonotify.py sample
